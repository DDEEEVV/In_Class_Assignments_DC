# ***The FinTech Domains:*** #


*Capital Rising*

*Deposit and Lending*

*Enterprise Financial Software*

*Investment Management*

*Market Provision*

*Payments*
# #

>**1- Capital Rising** is about providing customers with access to investments and raising capital in exchange for equity or/in return of interest rates. This domain can be further broken down in two areas: a) crowdfunding and b) alternative financing. a) Crowdfunding focuses on helping companies and entrepreneurs to raise capital for the business products, projects, or social courses. b) Alternative financing refers to innovative ways to raise capital without going to traditional incumbent financial institutions, it is focused on small and medium sized enterprises.

>**2- Deposit and Lending** focus on personal services in the area of loans and management of their finances and savings. It consists of three sub domains: 
>a) Personal Finance which focuses on supporting individuals household and budgeting as well as managing their financial decisions and activities; 
>b) Digital Banking in interactive online services for customers to do their banking services such as paying bills; transfer funds, and access to checking and savings accounts; 
>c) Alternative lending which complements the other by focusing on providing customers with credit scores and peer-to-peer loans without going to traditional financial institutions.

>**3- Enterprise Financial Software** This is software or IT solutions made for the financial sector. It includes tools for handling accounts, invoices, taxes, payroll, and shareholders management. Enterprise financial software can be broken into three areas as well:
>a) Collaboration and workflow software, are cloud based solutions and platforms that enable better communication and efficiency of internal processes. 
>b) Accounting and invoice software helps financial institutions to improve the time and resources spent on the bookkeeping and invoicing processes. 
>c) Data and analytics software helps financial institutions to fight off fraud security issues and cyber crime.

>**4- Investment Management** is services that help private and institutional investors in process of buying and selling assets and securities. This can be divided into: 
>a) Private investment management, which refers to automated processes and trading algorithms to private investors, that is private clients, or other tools to trade and manage their investments. 
>b) Institutional investment management, which focus on tools and technologies for institutional clients, that is professional investors of wealth and hedge funds, and investment institutions to manage their investment portfolios. 

>**5- Market Provision** Another part of FinTech domain that focuses on Market Provision. The goal is to improve transparency, connectivity, and accessibility of information in the market which allows buyers and sellers easily connect and engage with each other as well as allowing them to compare different financial products and services. Market Provision consist of two sectors:
>a) Comparison and matchmaking which is online aggregator platforms that allows customers to identify and compare financial products and services. 
>b) Financial social networks that focus on the use of social networks to facilitate interaction among buyers and sellers and to prove financial literacy and inclusion.

>**6- Payments** The final domain is Payments. This is actually the largest domain in terms of interest from investors. Payment is about payment services including payment back-end infrastructure, card issuing, merchant acquiring, mobile payment, seamless solutions and point of sales solution. This domain can broadly be understood in three sub-domains:
>a) Payments, back-end and infrastructure. This refers to payment processing providers, solutions for accepting electronic payments, point of sale terminals, and card providers and also mobile payments.
>b) Customer payments include mobile wallets and seamless payment solutions to enable payers to pay on the go and peer-to-peer transfer of money. 
>c) Cryptocurrency provide access to digital cryptocurrency market such as Bitcoin. So we can pay by accepting crypto currencies.

>>>>>>>>Now we have been introduced to six domains of FinTech which are: 
>>>>>>>>*Capital Rising*; *Deposit and Lending*; *Enterprise Financial Software*; *Investment Management*; *Market Provision* and *Payments*. 


> #### *What are FinTech's stages of growth?*
>
> # First Age of Fintech: Competition #
> - In 1858 a French missionary, Auguste Chapdelaine, was executed in China by lingchi. Lingchi was known as death by a thousand cuts. And the first age of FinTech is analogous. New FinTech companies, armed with VC *(Venture Capital)* cash and emboldened by the socio-political backlash against the big banks, launched services in direct competition to traditional lenders.
>Rather than going for complex, highly regulated areas of financial services, FinTech start-ups targeted low-entry, underserved segments that they could deliver at a better price with better technology. The major focus areas were payments, lending and wealth management.
>The idea was for 1,000s of different FinTechs to each take a small slice of the more profitable, easy to disrupt part of banking, instead of trying to build a major new competitor.
>This concept of “Death by a thousand cuts” was played out through the media with FinTechs joining forces to launch crusades against banks, lobby government for more support, and set-up industry bodies to coordinate their approach.
> # Second Age of Fintech: Collaboration #
> - While the Lingchi approach was successful for some, in the early 2010s the majority of FinTechs were coming around to the realisation that competition wasn’t best for their business.
>Fundamentally, FinTech’s were struggling to scale and acquire customers. This is common for nascent industries. However, the focus of early start-ups on payments, loans etc. exacerbated this problem.
>Most financial services are based on selling a low-margin product to many. While FinTech’s struggled to scale they lost money. And for every FinTech success there is 50 others that simply didn’t scale or have the right business model and failed.
>While FinTechs have the technology, it was their former arch enemies, the banks, that have the scale and distribution they needed. Conversely, banks needed the technology from FinTechs to plug the gaps in their offerings.
>Suddenly FinTechs went from competition to collaboration.  The image below shows all the ways that banks and FinTech’s started working together:

>
> Open Banking and the birth of the bank marketplace is the perfect distillation of this theme. Banks are creating marketplaces for FinTech’s to provide services (Starling Bank’s Marketplace is an excellent example of this) to consumers. Banks continue to own the customer and get a cut, FinTech’s get an enormous addressable market and instant scale.
> # Third Age of Fintech: Coopetition #
> - If it was competition before, and collaboration now, its coopetition next.
>Banks and FinTechs are facing headwinds from both the West and the East which could decimate their business.
>In the West we have the Silicon Valley internet giants – Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. The currency of these businesses is data – to sell us more stuff, directly or via advertisers. One of the most valuable forms of data is bank data, as it shows what a person is actually spending their money on.
>Google has launched Google Pay, Facebook has enabled money transfer via Messenger, and Amazon is rumored to be launching a credit card.
>To date they have dabbled, but signs are that their interest in banking is growing.
>My view is that none of the tech giants wants to be a bank – the regulation alone is too much of a pain – but they are keen to disintermediate banks with better basic services, probably tied intimately to their existing offerings (4% off all Amazon purchases vs. 0.5% interest rate?), and gather data.
>In the East, the Chinese giants Ant Financial (the world’s biggest FinTech at $150bn valuation) and Tencent are marching West.
>These organisations don’t regard themselves as banks, and in some cases are actively shifting away from finance. Ironically, this actually makes them more dangerous.
>
>Rather than offer financial services, Ant Financial for example, provides:
>- Retailing
>- Messaging
>- Social media
>- Transport
>- Medical services
>- Gaming
>- And many more things
>
>The application becomes a one-stop-shop for anything you could need. It’s the remote control for your digital lifestyle.
>In this approach, banking stops becoming a separate activity and entity, it simply becomes part of and an enabler for, your digital lifestyle. It’s invisible.
>All of a sudden FinTechs and banks aren’t up against other FinTechs and banks, but a company that >controls an entire ecosystem and digital lifestyle. That’s some serious stickiness.
>As the Silcon Valley players emerge from the West, and the Chinese players emerge from the East, >FinTech’s and Banks need to work together to compete with the common enemy.
>The Third Age of FinTech has begun. The question is, who will win?
